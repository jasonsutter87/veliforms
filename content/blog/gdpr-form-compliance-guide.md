The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has transformed how businesses collect and process personal data. For developers building web forms, compliance isn't optional—it's the law.

This guide breaks down what GDPR means for your forms and how to implement compliant data collection.

## What Data Do GDPR Rules Apply To?

GDPR applies to any "personal data" of EU residents. This includes:

- **Direct identifiers**: Names, email addresses, phone numbers
- **Indirect identifiers**: IP addresses, cookie IDs, device fingerprints
- **Sensitive data**: Health information, political opinions, religious beliefs

If your form collects any of this from EU users, GDPR applies—regardless of where your business is located.

## The 7 Key GDPR Principles for Forms

### 1. Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency

Users must know:
- What data you're collecting
- Why you're collecting it
- How long you'll keep it
- Who will have access

**For forms**: Include a clear privacy notice near your submit button. Link to your full privacy policy.

### 2. Purpose Limitation

Data collected for one purpose cannot be used for another without fresh consent.

**For forms**: If users submit a contact form, you can't add them to your marketing list unless they explicitly opt in.

### 3. Data Minimization

Only collect data you actually need.

**For forms**: Don't ask for phone numbers if you'll only contact users by email. Remove unnecessary fields.

### 4. Accuracy

Keep data accurate and up to date.

**For forms**: Provide users a way to update their submitted information.

### 5. Storage Limitation

Don't keep data longer than necessary.

**For forms**: Implement automatic data retention policies. Delete old submissions.

### 6. Integrity and Confidentiality

Protect data against unauthorized access, loss, or destruction.

**For forms**: Use encryption. This is where client-side encryption shines—data is protected from the moment of collection.

### 7. Accountability

You must demonstrate compliance.

**For forms**: Maintain records of consent, data processing activities, and security measures.

## Implementing Consent Collection

GDPR requires "freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous" consent. Here's how to get it right:

### Do's

```html
<form>
  <input type="email" name="email" required>

  <label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="marketing" value="yes">
    I agree to receive marketing emails about product updates
  </label>

  <label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="privacy" required>
    I have read and accept the <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
  </label>

  <button type="submit">Subscribe</button>
</form>
```

### Don'ts

- Pre-checked consent boxes
- Bundled consent (one checkbox for multiple purposes)
- Vague language ("We may contact you")
- Consent buried in terms of service

## The Right to Erasure (Right to Be Forgotten)

Users can request deletion of their data. Your form system must support this.

Requirements:
- Provide a clear way to request deletion
- Respond within 30 days
- Delete data from all systems, including backups

**VeilForms approach**: Each submission has a unique anonymous ID. Users can request deletion by ID, and we permanently remove the encrypted data.

## Privacy by Design

GDPR Article 25 requires "data protection by design and by default." This means privacy should be built into your systems, not added as an afterthought.

Client-side encryption is the ultimate privacy-by-design approach:

1. **Encryption by default**: All data is encrypted before transmission
2. **Data minimization**: PII can be detected and stripped automatically
3. **Access control**: Only you have the decryption keys
4. **No unnecessary processing**: The form provider only handles ciphertext

## Building a GDPR-Compliant Form: Complete Example

```html
<form data-veilform="contact_form" id="gdpr-form">
  <h2>Contact Us</h2>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="name">Name *</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="email">Email *</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  </div>

  <div class="form-group">
    <label for="message">Message *</label>
    <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>
  </div>

  <div class="consent-section">
    <label class="consent-checkbox">
      <input type="checkbox" name="privacy_consent" required>
      <span>I consent to VeilForms storing my encrypted submission
      to respond to my inquiry. <a href="/privacy">Privacy Policy</a></span>
    </label>
  </div>

  <p class="privacy-notice">
    Your data is encrypted in your browser before transmission.
    We retain submissions for 90 days, then permanently delete them.
    <a href="/privacy#data-rights">Exercise your data rights</a>
  </p>

  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

## Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

For high-risk data processing (health data, large-scale profiling), you need a DPIA. This documents:

- The nature and purpose of processing
- Risks to data subjects
- Measures to mitigate risks

Using client-side encryption significantly reduces risk, making DPIA easier to complete.

## Checklist: Is Your Form GDPR Compliant?

- [ ] Privacy notice displayed near the form
- [ ] Separate consent checkboxes for different purposes
- [ ] No pre-checked boxes
- [ ] Link to full privacy policy
- [ ] Secure data transmission (HTTPS + encryption)
- [ ] Data retention policy implemented
- [ ] Process for handling deletion requests
- [ ] Records of consent maintained
- [ ] Data processing agreement with form provider

## Penalties for Non-Compliance

GDPR violations can result in fines up to:

- **Tier 1**: €10 million or 2% of annual global turnover
- **Tier 2**: €20 million or 4% of annual global turnover

Beyond fines, there's reputational damage and loss of customer trust.
