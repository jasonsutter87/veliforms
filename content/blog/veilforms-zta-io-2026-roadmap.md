VeilForms has grown from a simple idea—encrypt form data before it leaves the browser—into a platform trusted by developers who refuse to compromise on privacy. Today, we're excited to share our vision for 2026 and our deeper integration with our parent company, ZTA.io.

## Our Journey So Far

When we launched VeilForms, we asked a simple question: why do form builders have access to your users' data at all?

The answer was always "because that's how it's done." We rejected that.

Client-side encryption, automatic PII detection, zero tracking—these aren't features. They're principles. And they've resonated with developers building for healthcare, finance, legal, and any industry where privacy matters.

## ZTA.io: The Foundation

For those unfamiliar, ZTA.io is our parent company focused on zero-trust architecture for modern applications. Their core belief: never trust, always verify. Every request, every user, every connection.

VeilForms was born from ZTA.io's research into data-in-transit protection. But the synergy goes deeper than origin stories.

## What's Coming in 2026

### Q1 2026: Enterprise Features

**Team Management**
- Role-based access control
- SSO/SAML integration
- Audit logs for compliance
- Team activity dashboard

**Advanced Analytics**
- Funnel analysis (privacy-preserving)
- A/B testing for forms
- Conversion optimization insights
- Custom reporting

### Q2 2026: Visual Form Builder

We've heard you. Not everyone wants to write HTML.

**Drag-and-Drop Builder**
- Privacy-first by design
- Conditional logic
- Multi-step forms
- Custom branding
- Accessibility baked in

**Key difference**: Unlike other builders, forms created with our builder will still use client-side encryption. The builder is just the interface—the security model stays the same.

### Q3 2026: ZTA.io Integration

This is the big one.

**Zero-Trust Form Endpoints**
- Forms protected by ZTA.io's identity verification
- Device trust scoring before form access
- Geofencing and IP reputation
- Behavioral analysis for bot detection

**Encrypted File Uploads**
- Client-side encrypted file attachments
- Large file support (up to 100MB)
- Virus scanning on encrypted files
- Automatic retention policies

**ZTA.io Identity Bridge**
- Pre-fill forms from verified identity
- Progressive disclosure based on trust level
- Passwordless form authentication

### Q4 2026: Open Source & Self-Hosting

We're committed to transparency.

**VeilForms Core (Open Source)**
- Client-side encryption SDK
- Basic form handling
- Self-host on your infrastructure
- Apache 2.0 license

**VeilForms Cloud (Managed)**
- Everything in Core, plus:
- Dashboard and analytics
- Team features
- Webhooks and integrations
- Priority support

This isn't "open core" bait-and-switch. The encryption and privacy features will be fully open source. We'll make money on convenience, not on holding privacy hostage.

## The Bigger Picture

ZTA.io's vision is a world where zero-trust isn't an enterprise luxury—it's the default. VeilForms fits into that by making privacy-first data collection accessible to everyone.

In 2026, you'll see:

1. **Tighter Integration**: VeilForms as a native component of ZTA.io's security suite
2. **Shared Identity**: One account for VeilForms and ZTA.io services
3. **Combined Protection**: Form security + network security + identity security
4. **Enterprise Ready**: SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA BAA, ISO 27001 certifications

## What Won't Change

Some things are non-negotiable:

- **Client-side encryption**: Always. No exceptions.
- **You control the keys**: We will never have access to your data.
- **Zero tracking**: We don't track your users. Period.
- **Transparent pricing**: No surprise fees. No usage gotchas.
- **Privacy by default**: Not an upsell. Not enterprise-only.

## Join Us

We're building the future of privacy-first data collection. Want to be part of it?

- **Feedback**: Tell us what you need—we're listening

The era of "trust us with your data" is ending. The era of "verify with math" is beginning.

See you in 2026.
